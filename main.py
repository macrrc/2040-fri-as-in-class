Entry point (orchestration only).

TODO (team):
- Prompt for input file path (interactive) — keep logic minimal.
- Call functions from text_stats.py to compute results.
- Print six output lines in exact format.
- Prompt for output file, confirm overwrite, write lines via io_ops.py.
- Ensure this file stays "thin" — no heavy logic here.
