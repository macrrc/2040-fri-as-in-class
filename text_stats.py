"""
Pure text-processing functions (no I/O or exceptions).

Responsibilities:
- Tokenize words (Aâ€“Z only, case-insensitive).
- Count characters (with and without spaces).
- Compute: word count, unique words, average word length (one decimal).
- Determine most common word(s) and frequency; alphabetical order for ties.
- Format the six output lines in the exact required text format.

Rules:
- No input(), no print(), no file I/O, no try/except here.
- Keep functions small, composable, and testable.
"""

# Hints (do not implement here yet):
# - Consider a constant regex pattern for words.
# - Separate calculation from formatting.
# - Return data structures that are easy to test.
